# What is this? 
This is an implementation of a binary search tree with simple features built as part of The Odin Project Ruby course.

## Features:
- build a balanced binary tree with node objects using #build_tree
- insert new nodes with #insert
- delete already existing nodes with #delete
- find a specific node with #find
- traverse the tree in level order or three kinds of depth first order (preorder, inorder, postorder) with #level_order, #preorder, #inorder or #postorder
- get the height of the tree with #height
- find the depth of a node with #depth
- check if a tree is balanced with #balanced?
- rebalance an unbalanced tree with #rebalance
