# Data structures are a collection of data values, the relationships among them 
# and the functions that can be applied to the data.

# TYPES:
  # array
  # linked list
    # linear collection where each element has a value attached to it and points to the next element
    # values can be inserted and removed without relocating the rest of the list like in an array
    # slower than arrays on certain operations
  # record
    # aggregate data structure
    # a record is a value that contains other values
  # hash table
  # graph
    # collections of vertices(nodes) connected by edges, representing relationships between entities
    # directed or undirected, cyclical or acyclical
  # stack/queue
    # abstract data types implemented using arrays or linked lists
    # push and pop add or remove an element at the top
    # work by the LIFO principle (last in, first out)
  # trees
    # hierarchical organization of elements
    # nodes connected by edges, where one node is the root while others form subtrees
  # trie
    # specialized tree for retrieval of strings
    # strings stored as nodes, with each edge representing a character
